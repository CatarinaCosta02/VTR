# VTR

Real-Time Visualization (Visualização em Tempo Real)

This github repository contains three main folders. 
The first one contains the individual project consisting of an article written in the VTR course, 
the second folder concerns the final group project for the course and the last folder contains the code that was developed in each class (in some of the classes the code is not completely complete).

## VTR_Individual

As mentioned earlier this folder contains an article whose topic is *Tree Generation Algorithms in Computer Graphics*. 
This article explores **L and DOL systems** focusing on their foundational principals and applications, **Space colonization Algorithms** and its way of generating comples organic structures,
**Procedural modeling** techniques using guiding vectors, and other relevent topics worth of learning.
It also highlights the goods and the bads of these algorithms and how they can represent and generate realistic trees structures of the natural world, in the computer graphis realm.

## VTR_Project

Regarding the group work, we were given a list of themes from which we chose the terrain generation theme.
We decided to make this choice since this topic not only sparked our interest, but also because of its visual and interactive component. 
This way, we applied the topic of terrain generation to the different seasons of the year.
